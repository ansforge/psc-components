# sec-psc component version history

## Principle

Each time one or more sec-psc components are released and delivered, add an entry in this file to record
the new component version combination (sec-psc distribution description).
Give this new distribution a semantic version number based on what changed (new features vs simple maintenance or bugfix). Push a mtching version tag.
